\section{Simulation setup} \label{section: implementation}
% TODO: Describe the implementation
% Py-PDE
% JIT
% 3D implemented, but not enough computational power => Z=1 (i.e., essentially 2D)
% + whatever else the rubric demands

% Additionally, we should explain that since we some quantities from a gaussian distribution, the simulation was repeated 3x and the average was taken (to increase the statistical significance of the results).
