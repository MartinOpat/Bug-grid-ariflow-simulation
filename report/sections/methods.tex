\section{Model and Methodology} \label{section: methods}
We aim to implement a numerical 3D simulation of airflow based on Navier-Stokes equations in Python. The numerical simulation will include discretising space and time. The cells that make up the bug grid will be modelled using a no-slip boundary condition.

\subsection{Assumptions:}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mass conservation
    \item Isotropy (i.e., no gravity)
    \item Compressible fluid
    \item Dynamic ($\mu$) and bulk ($\zeta$) viscosities are uniform in space
    \item Stoke's hypothesis ($\zeta=0$)
    \item Newtonian fluid
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Math}
The assumptions above yield the Navier-Stokes equation(s) \cite{batchelor2000introduction} in the following form:
\begin{equation}
{\left(\partial_t +\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla -\nu \,\nabla ^{2}-({\tfrac {1}{3}}\nu +\xi )\,\nabla (\nabla \cdot )\right)\mathbf {u} =-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p+\mathbf {f} ,}
\end{equation}

where $\rho$ is the mass density, $\vect{u}$ is velocity, $p$ is the pressure, $\nu$ is a shear kinematic viscosity parameter, $\xi$ is the bulk kinematic viscosity, and $\vect{f}$ is the body force (which is 0 due to isotropy).
Further "massaging" the equation:
\begin{gather}
    \partial_t \vect {u} + \underbrace{(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla) \vect {u} -\nu \,\nabla ^{2}\vect {u}-({\tfrac {1}{3}}\nu +\xi )\,\nabla (\nabla \cdot \vect {u})}_{f\left(\vect{u}\right)} =-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p,
\end{gather}
where $f(\vect{u})$ is a function of $\vect{u}$ and its spatial (partial) derivatives.
\begin{gather}
    % \partial_t \vect{u} + f(\vect{u}) = -{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p \\
    \partial_t \vect{u}  = -f(\vect{u}) -{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p \label{eq: NS-cont-final}
\end{gather}
Applying the finite difference method to the time derivative in eq. \ref{eq: NS-cont-final}, we get:
\begin{gather}
    \frac{\vect{u}_{ijk}^{n+1} - \vect{u}_{ijk}^n}{\Delta t} = -f(\vect{u}^n) -{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p \\
    \vect{u}_{ijk}^{n+1} = \vect{u}_{ijk}^n - \Delta t \left(f(\vect{u}^n) + {\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p\right), \label{eq: NS-fd}
\end{gather}
where $\Delta t$ is the discrete time-step size, $n$ is the time-step index, and $i,j,~\text{and}~k$ are the indices in the $x,y,~\text{and}~z$ spatial coordinates respectively. We can apply the finite difference method to all the (spatial) derivatives in $f$ in the same way as we did above.

We also impose the no-slip boundary condition at the location of the rectangular bug grid, as well as on the walls around the window:
\begin{gather}
    \forall i,j,k \in [\text{grid},~\text{window}] ~\forall n:~ \vect{u}_{ijk}^n = \vect{0} \label{eq: boundary}
\end{gather}
